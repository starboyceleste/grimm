# Chapter 2 - Crimes against Humanity

### Article VI: Respect

We encourage players to cooperate and compete in a positive environment, but never in a way that disrespects or abuses other players. In short: **Be respectful to all players.** These rules are in place to maintain a welcoming and safe environment for all players.

### Article VII: Roleplaying

Players should always have a character conceptualized for themselves and act in the best intention of their in-world character.

Establish an out of character communication to ensure both parties are aware roleplay is happening before any conflicts between characters. Any drama or conflict should remain with players' characters.

**Relations and tension should be already developed before initiating any large-scale offense.**&#x20;

### Article VIII: Wilderness

Claiming ownership of the wilderness without a land chunk claim is prohibited.

Containers and buildings not in or not immediately outside claimed territory are not protected and are not insured by the server. This is to help clear obscure builds and encourage players to establish territories.

### Article IX: Public Misinformation and Noninformation

Exploitation or personal gain from deliberate misinformation or non-mutual noninformation is prohibited.

**Noninformation Grace Period:** Period of noninformation is voided after 24 hours of any piece of official content being released. Beyond this period, noninformation of Grimm material is no longer insured.
