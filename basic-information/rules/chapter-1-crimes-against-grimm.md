<summary>Categories of Allowed Modifications</summary>

Provided below is a list of the categories of modifications we permit on the server, along with an explanation of what each of these categories does and does not include and permit. If a modification does not fit into one of these categories, it should be assumed that it is disallowed by default.

### Client Performance Improvement Modifications

Modifications that simply seek to improve the performance of the Minecraft client without making changes to the game itself, such as those which improve the FPS of the Minecraft client.

### Aesthetic Modifications

Modifications that change only the look and feel of the game without modifying gameplay, such as standard shader modifications or even resource packs. However, these **must not** change the properties of blocks (e.g. make non-transparent blocks transparent) or change the player's perspective (e.g. allowing them to see around or over objects they normally wouldn't be able to).

### **C**osmetic HUD Modifications

Modifications that alter the look and feel of the in-game head-up display (HUD), without adding extra information which would normally be unavailable to the player. For example, HUDs adding armor and status effects, which are available to the player in their inventory screen, are permitted, while mini-maps, other player health/armor indicators, player distance/range, etc. are not.

### Brightness & Gamma Adjustment Modifications

Modifications that alter the brightness and gamma settings of the Minecraft client, allowing you to see in darker areas that would normally be too dark to see in.
