# The Sekai Accords

This is a document of all rules placed in Grimm IV.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some rules may be enforced by in-world parties. Rather than by administrators, these may be handled in a court of law.
{% endhint %}

Players found intentionally assisting in, knowingly participating in, or knowingly benefitting from other players breaking any of the rules listed on this page may be subject to appropriate consequences as well.



## Consequences dealt by the server

Players found breaking these rules can expect a suspension of chat privileges or access to the Grimm server and Discord. You may find that lesser rules may be open to a jury's verdict in an in-world court of law.

Our rules are here to maintain a welcoming and safe environment for all players and facilitate fair roleplay standards.
