# Chapter 4 - Crimes of Engagement

### Preface into Chapter 4-5:

War on Grimm is designed to be available as a tool to promote and progress roleplay, resolve disputes between players, and add an element of risk and grit to an otherwise peaceful gameplay loop. In many ways though, this fails. This document is imperfect. To fill in the fundamental flaws that would otherwise be impractical to outline here, war should be conducted in a way that is based in roleplay. This is better for the community, personal relations between players, and the war experience itself.

This document should be read carefully and understood by all players looking to engage in combat, but beyond them, into figures that have yet to be or cannot be outlined, players should carefully consider their actions and whether they promote a positive competitive environment or are the beginnings of the toxic derailment of another player's experience. This is not to say that every combative action is destructive, but that in-character roleplay and out-of-character communication are two incredibly effective means to go about creating a positive competitive experience for everyone.

#### Other important notes:

* "State", "Team", and "Land" are used in this document interchangeably.
* "Target .." and "Defending .." are used in this document interchangeably.
* Accurate as of 6/30, players drop 10% of their balance upon death, regardless of cause. This is to encourage states to act as "banks" for their members and make.
* Regardless of the tribute set, an attacking state's surrender will pay 10% of their land balance towards the defending state.

### Article XII: Anatomy of War

\[1] Denouncement

Before initiating any combat, measures to publicly denounce the target state should be made.

> At this point, the only valid combat is to deny intruders in one's own land.&#x20;

\[2] Declaration of War

To declare war, players can type the command, `/war declare <land>`. This declaration should be documented in the `#events` text channel with an appropriate [casus belli](chapter-4-crimes-of-engagement.md#article-xiii-casus-belli-and-types-of-war), tribute, and any additional roleplay.

* Tribute: The defender land will need to pay this value in order to surrender. This value is set in a declaration by the attacker. The attacker must accept all surrenders. Accurate as of 6/30: the maximum amount of this value can only be 20% of the defending land's balance.

\[3] Preparation Period

See: [No Man's Land](chapter-4-crimes-of-engagement.md#article-xiv-no-mans-land).

After a declaration of war, the next 12 hours are a preparation period. During this time, combat is only permitted in the wilderness.

\[4] War

War is won in two ways: domination and surrender.

In the duration of the war, both sides must gain points by performing the following actions:

* Kill: 1 point.
* Capture: 3 points.
* Cancel a capture: 1 points. (Defender only)

The amount of points needed to win is 20 points per team member of the team with the smallest amount of players. The minimum amount will always be 50 points.

In the `/war` menu, players can view the crafting recipe to make a capture flag. Placing this flag on an enemy's territory will begin a capture that will need to be defended for 5 minutes.

If no team has reached the total amount needed to win, after 48 hours, the war will end in favor of the team with the most kills.

\[5] War Shield

When a war shield is active, the affected land cannot be a target of war. A war shield is applied by default for 3 days when a land is created.

When a land surrenders, this land receives a 1 day war shield.

When a land's war ends, both lands receive a 12 hour war shield.

### Article XIII: Denouncement

The following actions to publicly denounce a state must be taken before any conflict can be initiated by either side:

* The defending land should be declared an enemy in the `/lands relations` menu.
* A public denouncement of the defending land should be made in the `#events` chat channel, including a case for war and an explicit mention of the defending land's leader.

At this point, the only valid combat is to deny intruders in one's own land.&#x20;
