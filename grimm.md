# Grimm

## Overview

Grimm is a Minecraft SMP community focused on fantasy worldbuilding, roleplaying, and collaborative storytelling.&#x20;

In the current Grimm IV, the game features a fantasy open-world sandbox environment and action based combat mechanics including gunplay, magic, and player classes. Players can join or create nations to secure their belongings and creations as well as wage war against each other to participate in roleplay and conflict.

Grimm released as a public server on August 28, 2020 for Minecraft version 1.16. Sequentially a more polite and laid-back sequel was released on November 21, 2020 as well as a more ambitious reboot, Grimm III, on July 14, 2021. Grimm IV was released on May 20, 2022.

## Gameplay

> Explore relics of time and investigate cryptic mysteries that'll lead you closer to fully uncovering the story. Players will enter a fatigued Elyssia, recovering from war and blighted by deeper scars of the past.

Players explore the game's large fantasy world, called Elyssia, as one of three [class archetypes](getting-started/choosing-your-class..md) and various points of interest spread across the map. The game features an action combat skill system that allows the player to manage several abilities. Collaboration with other players and roleplay are the focus of the game.

Each class archetype has unique crafting recipes. Players are able to freely switch between classes, but must progress significant amounts of time in a class to unlock its crafting recipes.&#x20;

Crafting and travel are significant aspects of Grimm's gameplay. Players can craft class items at Forges, scattered across the map. Forges are nearly always found next to Statues of The Dalai Llama, which act as teleport waystones for players to travel far distances instantly at the cost of Dove, the currency of Elyssia.



## Story

### Setting

> The story of Grimm IV takes place in a pre-apocalyptic 20th century. After thousands of years, humans have struggled to conquer even their first frontier: their own planet Elyssia. Their Golden Age of discovery and development burnt out in a fickle whimper- and extinction for them was just below the horizon.
>
> The Grimm series is a tragedy: one about misdirection, survival, and the fall of that prodigy child, Humanity.

In the [promo reveal of Grimm IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUyr7EzW91w), a uniformed soldier is labelled as "the first Cardinal". Laid aghast in the middle of a city street, the soldier peers to his side and presumably sees his younger self looking back at him â€” as shown with an identical scar right of the forehead. The next scenes are of the previous city street with the soldier no longer present.
