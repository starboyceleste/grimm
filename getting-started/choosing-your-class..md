# Choosing your class.

Choosing a class determines which class-specific items you'll be able to unlock later on. You can freely change your class as you play.

To select your class, interact with the menu at [Lueheon](http://grimm-atlas.lol/?worldname=elyssia\&mapname=atlas\&zoom=3\&x=1613\&y=64\&z=-4376) when you spawn initially.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can change your class later, but player stats like level, attributes, and skill points will not be transferred.
{% endhint %}

## The Revenant

> "You're a revenant, a suffered soul. The revenants were sought after to look to the stars and chart the destinies of great empires. But damn it all — what you saw were visions of annihilation. In it, you fell into an infinite void. It hurt you. And in the end, your soul returned to a world that no longer remembered you, consequently becoming "stranded" in the world of the living."

## The Vagabond

> "You're a vagabond, a weary soul. When the world was a vessel to conquer, you chose your hill to die on and inspired generations. You had a purpose and a life to fight for, but now a shadow hangs over you. It's apparent in your eyes — you've wandered alone for an eternity. God, you're fucking tired."

## The Titan

> "You're a titan, a valiant soul. When humanity foresaw its first extinction, it was titans that planted their roots and led. "You're strong, but you are nothing," _it_ said, and then you learnt that entire worlds could crumble. Humans were fragile. You couldn't protect everyone. Your line of succession began from something great — but now a black ink stains your hem.'"
