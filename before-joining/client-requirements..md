  Grimm IV was designed with the following client settings and modifications,
  these are highly recommended for the intended player experience.

# Client requirements.

## Minimum:

These settings are required and will generally keep you from joining the server if you do not have them. Make sure you have these set properly before joining.

### Server Resource Packs: Enabled.

Grimm has a heavy library of custom content that relies on our server resource pack.&#x20;

_To enable it, simply accept the prompt you receive when you first join the server._&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you've accidentally denied it upon joining,

* Select Grimm IV in your server list.
* Click `Edit` in the bottom left.
* Enable `Server Resource Packs`.
{% endhint %}

### Particles: All.

Many mechanics in Grimm rely on effects and visual cues ran on particle systems. Set your particles to `All` to make sure you're not missing out on anything.

## Recommended:

These settings are my own recommendations based on Grimm's own server parameters. You will be able to connect and play on the server without these settings, but they're highly recommended.

### Render Distance: Minimum, 4 chunks.

Player entities on the server have a tracking range of 64 blocks. This means that players will only render to the client in that range. So, for the competitive element, I recommend setting your render distance to at least 4 chunks.

### OptiFine or other optimization mod.

OptiFine is a Minecraft optimization mod. It allows Minecraft to run faster and look better with full support for HD textures and many configuration options.&#x20;
